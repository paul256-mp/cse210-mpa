Meaning of Version Control
Version control is a system that helps manage changes to documents, code, and other files over time
It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.

Benefit of Version Control
One significant benefit of version control is collaboration. It enables teams to work together efficiently by managing and merging changes from multiple contributors.

Example of Version Control in a Software Development Team
In a software development team, version control is essential. Developers work on different parts of the codebase and commit their changes to a central repository. This repository keeps a history of all changes, making it possible to track the evolution of the software. Team members can create branches to work on new features independently and merge their changes once they're complete and tested. This workflow ensures that the main codebase remains stable and reduces the chances of introducing bugs.

git commit -m "Add feature X"
